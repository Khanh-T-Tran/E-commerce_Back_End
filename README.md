## Description
    This application is showing the basic back end set up of an E-commerce website, using Express.js API, Sequelize, and MySQL database.

## User Story
    AS A manager at an internet retail company
    I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
    SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Acceptance Criteria

    WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
    THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
    WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
    THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
    WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
    THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
    WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
    WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
